Cargo is the package manager for rust real-world projects, and also Rust's build system. It manages the dependecies when rustc is to compile a program.
Libraries are called dependencies and Cargo is responsible for downloading and build it.


We can create a project using cargo new.
We can build a project using cargo build.
We can build and run a project in one step using cargo run.
We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using cargo check.
Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.

cargo build --release; to generate the final program at target/release/ and compiled with optimizations
